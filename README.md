# Mensuration Calculator
This is a simple geometric calculator designed to calculate the area, perimeter, volume and surface area of various geometric figures. The supported figures are Circle, Square, Rectengle, Parallelogram, Rhombus, Trapezium, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere, Cube and Cuboid.

# Usage
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the name of the geometric figure you want to calculate. You will then be prompted to enter the required measurements for that figure based on the operation you want to perform.

For example, if you want to calculate the area of a circle, you would enter "Circle" as the figure name, and "Area" as the operation. You would then be prompted to enter the radius of the circle.

If you need to calculate the perimeter of a square, you would enter "Square" as the figure name, and "Perimeter" as the operation. You would then be prompted to enter the length of one side of the square.

# Supported Operations
The calculator supports the following operations for each figure:

● Circle: Area, Circumference

● Square: Area, Perimeter

● Rectengle: Area, Perimeter

● Triangle: Area, Perimeter

● Parallelogram: Area, Perimeter

● Rhombus: Area, Perimeter

● Trapezium: Area, Perimeter

● Cylinder: Volume, Curved Surface Area, Total Surface Area

● Cone: Volume, Curved Surface Area, Total Surface Area

● Sphere: Volume, Surface Area

● Cube: Volume, Curved Surface Area, Total Surface Area

# Input Guidelines
To ensure accurate calculations, please follow these guidelines when entering input values:

● For Circle, enter the radius in Length_or_Radius_or_Diagonal1.

● For Triangle, enter the base in Breadth_or_base_or_Diagonal2 and the height in Height_or_Other_side.

● For Parallelogram, enter the four sides in the four input sections.

● For Rhombus, enter the diagonals in Length_or_Radius_Diagonal1 and Breadth_or_base_or_Diagonal2.

● For Trapezium, enter the four sides in the four input sections for perimeter, and the lengths of the parallel sides in Length_or_Radius_Diagonal1 and Breadth_or_base_or_Diagonal2 for area.

● For Cone, enter the radius in Breadth_or_base_or_Diagonal2 for all surface area calculations.

# Note
If an input section does not require any value for a particular operation, enter "0".

All string inputs should start with capital letters but end with small letters (Example: Circle, Square, Total Surface Area).

# Conclusion
This geometric calculator is a useful tool for calculating the area, perimeter, volume and surface area of various geometric figures. Follow the input guidelines to ensure accurate results.
